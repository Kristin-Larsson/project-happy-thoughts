# Happy Thoughts

In this project I have learned:

✓ What component lifecycle means.
✓ How to use the `useEffect` hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
✓ How to call APIs from React and put the data into state.
✓ What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## The problem

When making this weeks project I had alot of use of the knowledge from last week. Several times I went back to basic and started all over again just to understand all the steps. I didn't do extra functions instead I focused on understanding all the steps, the code I wrote and how everything is connected.
